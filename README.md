This repo contains example code for an article I wrote, about JAM Stack, (netlify-cms + gatsbyjs). If you want to know more, check out the **[article](https://medium.com/@maciejmatu)**!

I used [gatsby-starter-netlify-cms](https://github.com/AustinGreen/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms) as a boilerplate. It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.
