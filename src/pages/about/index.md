### We care about our smoothies
Each of our product is handled with care. When our smoothies are aging, we play them Bach and Mozart.

### Plastic Free
We don't use plastic. We care about seagulls and stuff. We use only recycled glass bottles. Sometimes we even don't wash the bottles before reusing them, because we want to save water. Take an example of use. Go 200% green!

### Best Ingredients
All our fruits are imported from their origin countries. We bought a couple of F-16 jets, to transport them as fast as possible, without loosing any flavour. Oil is overrated. The real country value lies in it's fruit.

### Approved Taste
We got the best possible ratings from the biggest smoothie critics, and it wasn't because we employ the only two of them, that are currently working. They truly forgot about the fact that they rely on us when it comes to their well being and salary.
