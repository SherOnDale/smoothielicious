I finally opened my imaginary smoothie store! How I did it? The story is quite long. It starts with me being 5-year old, and selling lemonade. That's how I made my first 100 thousand dollars. The trick was to sell with your looks and childish naivety. 10 years later i still use those tricks.

## Funding 101

Finding investors was really hard. I had a few friends in the white house, and the NSA, so that helped a bit. The first funding round was closed at 100 million dollars. I cheated a bit, because I added 'block-chain' keywords across my smoothie shop pitch. It made a lot of people interested in my business. 

## The Future?

I kind-a achieved my goal already, so the next steps will be actually opening the store. Right now only the online orders work, so I highly recommend ordering a few thousand of my awesome smoothies. I'll post a next blog in the near feature, so be alert!
