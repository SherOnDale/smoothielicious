Well this will be a quick one, but I had to share the news publicly. 

## I'M RETIRING!!!

After making a billion on my crazy good smoothies, I decided to lean back, buy a cabin in the woods, and research maple syrup possibilities. Who knows, maybe my next venture will be about conquesting Canadian markets...

Anyway, see you in a few years. It was a pleasure!
